# CosmologicalSimulation
 
 
 
## Overview
It is a simple program that allows you to simulate a cluster of stars in 2D.  
Given the masses, initial positions and velocities of a group of stars, the simulations shows how the star cluster evolves over time. 

## Dependencies
The program is written in C++.  
Used **[simplecpp](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ranade/simplecpp/)** package to render the animations.
